# BlockIt

## Abstract
BlockIt uses an Ethereum Smart Contract to add any artifact to the Ethereum blockchain.  This mostly allows me to play around with smart contracts and build out a mock smartphone app that will use BlockIt.  Sample use-cases might include:
- Document an agreement between two people.
- Document the completion of a given milestone (course completion)
- Micro Credentialing for professionals.



## Use Case Scenario - Micro-Credentialing
..* A credential owner might add a list of credentials.   They ultimately own the credentials.   For example, a credential owner might be a certificaton board that requires Real-Estate agents to meet certain requirements or pass certain exams.  For example, the ISO9001 board or SOCII board might list a set of micro-credentails that validate competency in a given area.  The owners are only resonsible for maintaining the list of credentails.  It's possible that they will be involved in approving providers.
..* A provider registers themselves as a provider in the system (ProviderName, Id, WallettAddress, actual addresss (later))
..* The provider can register any number of micro-credentails they feel they are authorized to offer.  Initially, a contract owner might be a state department of education.  Or the contract might be made up of a set of teaching standards.  
..* The general public can rate any provider with a thumbs up or a thumbs down.
..* AS I'm baking this one out, I'm reaslizing it's a massive application that will require lots of ongoing enhancements. Not well suited for Smart Contracts.


## BlockIt
..* ANy owner can create a simple contract to document anything.  For example, the user might block an agreement between two people. Or a memory.  Or a thought.
